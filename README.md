# CSL106
Different codes for Implementing Data Structures and Algorithms


# Assignment 1
Write a program which stores the records of the students of a class CSL106. Every student attending this class has these set of common properties: Name, Enrollment Number, CGPA, Phone Number, subjects registered in the current semester. We need to store this information in the memory in such a way that the memory is only allocated to individual records at run time to minimize the unused memory. The records must be stored in sorted order every time a new record is inserted. The sorting must happen based on the enrollment number of a student record. One can always delete a record given the enrollment number. The records must provide a facility for efficient sorted traversal and reversely sorted traversals. Please decide a data structure to use and object oriented concept to apply to create a program for this scenario in C++. You must comment the code and take necessary assumptions.

# Assignment 2
There is a round table. People sit on the table to do dinner. They sit in clockwise manner. Once the table is full a queue is maintain to accommodate members waiting for their turn. However whenever there is a VIP waiting the queue is treated as a stack and the person is added to the front of the queue. Simulate this scenario with the help of a data structure such that people can be added deleted from the dining table and additional people can be maintained in the waiting queue.
