# CSL106
Different codes for Implementing Data Structures and Algorithms


## Assignment 1
Write a program which stores the records of the students of a class CSL106. Every student attending this class has these set of common properties: Name, Enrollment Number, CGPA, Phone Number, subjects registered in the current semester. We need to store this information in the memory in such a way that the memory is only allocated to individual records at run time to minimize the unused memory. The records must be stored in sorted order every time a new record is inserted. The sorting must happen based on the enrollment number of a student record. One can always delete a record given the enrollment number. The records must provide a facility for efficient sorted traversal and reversely sorted traversals. Please decide a data structure to use and object oriented concept to apply to create a program for this scenario in C++. You must comment the code and take necessary assumptions.
